# Computational Physics I 

## Yachay Tech University - 2023

## About this repository:
This is a collection of lecture notes and programming exercises carried out as part of the Computational Physics 1 course at Yachay Tech University from April to August 2023.

## Lecturer:
Wladimir Banda Barragán

## Course description:
This course provides an introduction to basic methods and techniques used in computational physics as well as an overview of recent progress made in several areas of scientific computing. The course describes basic concepts of object-oriented programming and includes detailed step-by-step examples of how to optimally utilise computers and programming languages to solve problems in physics. Topics range from data analysis and approximation and optimisation of functions, through numerical calculus and differential equations, to matrix operations and spectral analysis. Each section of the course includes practical examples on different areas of science and technology in which computational physics has played a major role in the last decade.

## Evaluation:

Evaluation has 4 components, with weights distributed as follows:

**1. Formative Evaluation (2 Homework):** 20%

**2. Laboratory (2 Classwork):** 20%

**3. 1 Midterm Exam:** 30%

**4. 1 Final Exam:** 30%

These components consist of the following tasks:

- Homework include long application problems.

- Classwork are quizzes with two components: one is carried out in class, one is carried out at home.

- Both the midterm and final exams have two components, one is carried out in class, one is carried out at home.


## Very important policies:

There will be neither make-up assignments nor make-up exams. Please do your best in every assignment.

Late assignments without appropriate justification will receive a penalisation according to the following criteria:

- 0-1 day late: -25%

- 1-2 days late: -50%

- 2-3 days late: -75%

- +3 days late: no marks

Late assignments accompanied by appropriate justification (e.g. a medical certificate, etc.) will receive no penalisation.


## Calendar:

All dates have a +/- 1 week error bar:

**1. Classwork 1:** Friday 19/05/2023

**2. Homework 1:** Friday 30/06/2023

**3. Midterm exam:** Tuesday 27/06/2023

**4. Classwork 2:** Tuesday 04/07/2023

**5. Homework 2:** Tuesday 25/07/2023

**6. Final Exam:** Tuesday 08/08/2023


The definite assignment deadlines and exam dates will be discussed and agreed upon in class. Once fixed, all deadlines are hard deadlines.


## Weekly tutoring schedule:

If you have questions on the material, you can find me in the office:

- On Tuesdays: 15:00 – 16:00 

- On Thursdays: 16:00 – 17:00


## On academic integrity:

- Students are responsible for ensuring the academic integrity of their submitted assignments and exams.

- Cheating in exams, plagiarising, and copying code or solutions from the Internet, from other students, or from previous years' solutions are all breaches of academic integrity.

- Academic misconduct will be penalised according to our University’s regulations.
