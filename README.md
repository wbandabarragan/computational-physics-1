# Computational Physics I 

## Yachay Tech University - 2025

## About this repository:
This is a collection of lecture notes and programming exercises carried out as part of the Computational Physics 1 course at Yachay Tech University.

## Lecturer:
Wladimir Banda Barragán

## Course description:
This course provides an introduction to basic methods and techniques used in computational physics as well as an overview of recent progress made in several areas of scientific computing. The course describes basic concepts of object-oriented programming and includes detailed step-by-step examples of how to optimally utilise computers and programming languages to solve problems in physics. Topics range from data analysis and approximation and optimisation of functions, through numerical calculus and differential equations, to matrix operations and spectral analysis. Each section of the course includes practical examples on different areas of science and technology in which computational physics has played a major role in the last decade.

## Evaluation:

Evaluation has 4 components, with weights distributed as follows:

**1. Formative Evaluation (2 Homework):** 20%

**2. Laboratory (at least 4 Quizzes):** 20%

**3. 1 Midterm Exam:** 30%

**4. 1 Final Exam:** 30%

These components consist of the following tasks:

- Homework include long application problems.

- Classwork are quizzes with two components: one is carried out in class, one is carried out at home.

- Both the midterm and final exams have two components, one is carried out in class, one is carried out at home.


## On deadlines:

The assignment deadlines and exam dates will be discussed and agreed upon in class. Once fixed, all deadlines are hard deadlines.


## Weekly tutoring schedule:

If you have questions on the material, you can find me in the office:

- On Tuesdays: 10:00 - 11:00

- On Thursdays: 15:00 - 16:00 


## On academic integrity:

- Students are responsible for ensuring the academic integrity of their submitted assignments and exams.

- Cheating in exams, plagiarising, and copying code or solutions from other students, from previous years' solutions, and/or from Internet sources are all breaches of academic integrity.
  
- The above includes copying code from AI chatbots (which are neither designed nor optimised for physics and programming), e.g. copying and pasting code from chatGPT infringes academic integrity.

- Academic misconduct will be penalised according to our University’s regulations.

## Late assignment policy:
Late assignments accompanied by appropriate justification (e.g. a medical certificate, etc.) will receive no penalisation. Late assignments without appropriate justification will receive a penalisation of -1% per late hour.

## Acknowledgements:
