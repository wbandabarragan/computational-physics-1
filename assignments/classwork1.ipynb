        "\n",
        "This problem consists of studying the motion of the interface of a circular gas bubble that expands isotropically from an initial radius $r_0 = 10\\,[m]$. The detailed expansion of gas bubbles requires defining an equation of state for the gas and solving the fluid dynamical equations, but, as a first approximation, the expansion can be studied from a purely kinematical view point. For this problem, you will then use simple kinematics to study bubble expansion in 2D.\n",
        "\n",
        "Depending on the properties of the medium in which the bubble expands, the time-dependent radius of the bubble, $r_t$, can follow different acceleration functions:\n",

Then, define $r_0$ as a global parameter, create a time vector, $t$, that goes from $0$ to $5\\,[s]$ with $11$ elements in between, and test the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "(b) Create a Python function to generate circumferences centred in the origin of a 2D Cartesian plane. The function should return the $(x,y)$ coordinates of circumferences given a value for the radius and a vector containing values for the angle $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\,\\pi]$. The latter can be defined as a global parameter. Recall that the coordinates of a circumference can be obtained as follows:\n",

        "\n",
        "(d) Use the time vector created in (a) to calculate $r_t$ and the $(x,y)$ circumference coordinates for different media by calling the functions developed in (a) and (b), respectively. **Hint:** Creating empty lists to host the desired variables and using a for loop to compute the time-dependent radii (and fill up the lists) would be advantageous for this step.\n",
        "\n",
        "(e) Make a single figure showing the radii, $r_t$, computed in step (d) versus time. The plot should contain 4 lines showing the time evolution of the radii for different media. The radii should be on the Y axis and time on the X axis. In which medium did the bubble expand the farthest within the given time-scale?\n",
        "\n",
        "(f) Finally, make a 4-panel figure showing all the circumferences computed in step (d). Each panel should contain the results for a different medium, and, as before, the limits for the X and Y axes should go from $-100$ to $+100\\,[m]$ in all the panels for better visualisation of the expanding bubbles. **Hint:** Using pyplot's subplots function and a for loop would help to obtain this figure."
