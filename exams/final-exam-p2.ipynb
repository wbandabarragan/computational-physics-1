    "## 2. Monte Carlo simulations: Particle Physics (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "High-energy cosmic-ray muons travel through matter and lose energy approximately linearly with the depth they traverse. Their final measured energy, $E_{\\rm f}$, after passing through a distance $x$ of material can be related to their initial energy, $E_0$, through:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_{\\rm f} = E_0 - \\alpha x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is the average energy loss rate in $\\rm MeV/cm$. Since muons have a distribution of initial energies, we can estimate their original energy spectrum by measuring the final energies of those that reach a detector. However, selection effects associated with the detector’s energy threshold can bias these measurements: only muons with sufficiently large $E_{\\rm f}$ can be detected. Muons that lose too much energy before reaching the detector will not be observed, making the detected sample biased towards higher initial energies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore, to understand selection bias, we want to simulate this effect using a Monte Carlo simulation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this problem is to determine the bias as a function of depth for a sample of muons via a Monte Carlo calculation. To set up your simulation, assume that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the mean initial muon energy is $E_0 = 3000\\,\\rm MeV$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the energy loss rate is $\\alpha = 2.0\\,\\rm MeV/cm$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- your detector will be able to detect $100$% of muons with final energies $E_{\\rm f} \\ge 800,\\rm MeV$, and none with lower energies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Write a python function to generate $N$ Gaussian random variables with mean $\\langle E_0\\rangle=3000\\,\\rm MeV$ and different standard deviations ($\\sigma_E=100$, $200$, and $300\\,\\rm MeV$).\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Make $3$ plots of $E_0$ versus $N$, where $N$ is the ID number of the generated muons, one for each $\\sigma_E$, jointly with their corresponding statistical distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Write a python function to calculate and return:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the depths, $x$, in $\\rm cm$ drawn uniformly between $0$ and $1000\\,\\rm cm$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the final measured energies, $E_{\\rm f}$, for the same depth range using $E_{\\rm f}=E_0-\\alpha x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Write a python function that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- reads the resulting $E_{\\rm f}$ values from item (c),\n",
    "\n",
    "- removes values with final energies smaller than the detection threshold $E_{\\rm f}=800\\,\\rm MeV$,\n",
    "\n",
    "- re-calculates the mean observed initial energy $\\langle E_{0,\\rm observed}\\rangle$ of the muons actually detected for the same depth range,\n",
    "\n",
    "- returns the bias as a function of depth. The bias in $E_0$ can be calculated with:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |\\Delta E|=|\\langle E_{0,\\rm observed}\\rangle - \\langle E_0\\rangle|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Make $3$ plots of $E_{\\rm f}$ versus $N$, where $N$ is the ID number of generated muons, one for each $\\sigma_E=100$, $200$, and $300\\,\\rm MeV$, jointly with their corresponding statistical distributions. Show the detection threshold and colour distinctly the muons that would not be detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Make $3$ plots of $|\\Delta E|$ versus $x$, one for each $\\sigma_E=100$, $200$, and $300\\,\\rm MeV$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(g) Based on your results, at which depths does selection bias become important in each case?"
