    "## Part 3. (10 points) Data analysis and visualisation (Rayleigh-Taylor instability)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Rayleigh-Taylor instability** occurs at the interface between two fluids of different densities when the lighter fluid is pushing the heavier fluid. Examples include the behavior of water suspended above oil in the gravity of Earth, mushroom clouds like those from volcanic eruptions and atmospheric nuclear explosions, supernova explosions in which expanding core gas is accelerated into denser shell gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will analyse a simulation of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability arising at the interface between 2 gases (one heavy and one light) in 2D. The initial condition consists of an interface separating two gases with different densities in hydrostatic balance:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "where $\\eta$ is the density of the gas on top in code units, $g$ is the (constant) gravity pointing in the negative $y$ direction. The system is destabilized by perturbing the vertical velocity in proximity of the interface using a single mode perturbation. The computational domain has **periodic boundary conditions** along the $X-$axis and and **reflective boundary conditions** along the $Y-$axis. The dimensions of the Cartesian domain are: $x\\in[-0.5,0.5]$ and $y\\in[-1.0,1.0]$ in code units.\n",

    "### Part A: I/O and visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a single python notebook, carry out the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Create a python function that reads the **units.out** file, stores the normalisation values for length, velocity, and density, calculates the normalisation values for thermal pressure and time, and returns them all into tuple objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "As shown in class, the normalisation values for thermal pressure ($p_0=\\rho_0\\,v_0^2$) and time ($t_0=\\frac{L_0}{v_0}$) can be derived from the length, velocity, and density values.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Create a python function that reads the **vtk.out** file, reads the second column, and returns the times in CGS units using $t_0$ from point (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Create a python function that reads a VTK data file, normalises the data fields to CGS units using the values from points (a) and (b), and returns them jointly with the mesh and time information as tuple objects. Note that the tracer is dimensionless, so it does not require normalisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Call all the above functions for VTK file **# 60** of each simulation, and make the following maps using the correct mesh coordinates, dimensions and time, all in in CGS units:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A figure showing the gas density, $\\rho$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A figure showing the entropy, $S = \\frac{P}{\\rho^\\gamma}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A figure showing showing the gas velocity, $\\vec{v}=\\vec{v}_x+\\vec{v}_y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A figure showing the tracer, $h_{gas}\\equiv \\rm tr1$, of the heavier gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:** Choose different perceptually-uniform colour schemes for each of the above quantities, and fix the colour bar limits. Add the correct time stamp in CGS units to each map. Since these are high-resolution models, one way to improve the visualisation of 2D vector fields is to interpolate them into a coarser grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B: Analysis of the thermodynamical quantities\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Create a set of Python functions that loop over all the VTK simulation files and returns maps of the density field $\\rho$, the entropy $S = \\frac{P}{\\rho^\\gamma}$, and also histograms of the density field and entropy in CGS units for all times, into a folder called **\"output_data\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Briefly describe: what happens with the density and entropy fields as time progresses? Do they follow any statistical distributions at late times?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part C: Time evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "(g) Create a set of Python functions that loops over all the VTK simulation files, computes the following quantities in CGS units for each time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the average gas temperature, $\\overline T$, (**Hint:** the temperature in each grid cell can be calculated using the equation of state for ideal gases, i.e., $p=\\frac{\\rho\\,k_B\\,T}{\\mu\\,m_u}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $m_u$ is the atomic mass unit, and $\\mu=0.6$ is the mean particle mass in the gas.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- the average entropy, $\\overline S$, where $S = \\frac{P}{\\rho^\\gamma}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the average kinetic energy density of the gas, $\\overline E_k$, where $E_k = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\,v^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the average sound speed of the heavier gas, $\\overline c_{s,h}$, where $c_{s,h}=h_{gas}\\,\\sqrt{\\gamma\\,\\frac{p}{\\rho}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a CSV file with 5 columns, time on the first column, and the above quantities in the next ones. The CSV file should be named **\"stats.csv\"** saved into the folder called **\"output_data\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "(h) Create a Python function that reads in the CSV file created in (g) and returns (i.e. shows or saves) high-quality labeled figures of each of the above-computed quantities versus time, into the folder called **\"output_data\"**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part D: Animations and steady state\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Briefly describe: What happens to the average kinetic energy and the average sound speed of the heavier gas as time progresses? Does the flow reach steady state? \n",
    "\n",
    "(j) Create a Python function that returns movies showing the time evolution of the entropy maps computed in (d) and the average values of the entropy calculated in (g). The movies should be saved into the folder called **\"output_data\"**. "
