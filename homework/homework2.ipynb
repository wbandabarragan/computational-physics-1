    "# Supersonic turbulence: Calculus and Fourier analysis (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to study the properties of 2D (magnetohydrodynamical) turbulent flows using numerical calculus and Fourier analysis. As explained in class, in a turbulence simulation the gas is initially still and has a uniform density distribution. Then, turbulence is generated by appying a time-dependent, spatially-varying, stochastic force field. Such force field continuously injects mechanical energy into the 2D box and maintains supersonic motions during the whole simulation. The gas in this simulation is isothermal, so it is described by this equation of state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p = \\rho\\,c_{\\rm iso}^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho$ is the gas density and $c_{\\rm iso}$ is its isothermal sound speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerical simulation produces $101$ VTK files stored in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the **TURB_DRIVE_SUP_hr** folder: \n",

    "## 1. (5 points) Numerical calculus:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Create a set of Python functions that reads in the simulation data, normalises the data fields to CGS units (using units.out), returns all the data arrays and the mesh, and sequentially prints the following figures into a folder called **\"output_n\"** for all times:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thermal pressure, $p = \\rho\\,c_{\\rm iso}^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Velocity curl (vorticity) magnitude, $|\\vec\\nabla\\times \\vec v|$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Magnetic pressure gradient, $\\vec{\\nabla}P_B$ where $P_B=\\frac{B^2}{8\\pi}$ is the magnetic pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add time-stamps in CGS units to the above maps (using information from vkt.out). Show sample maps at a fixed time (VTK file # 50) in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Create a set of Python functions that loops over all the simulation VTK files, computes the flow circulation, $\\Gamma = \\iint_S \\vec\\nabla\\times \\vec v \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{S}$, and returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a CSV file with 2 columns (time and flow circulation).\n",
    "\n",
    "- a figure of the flow circulation versus time. Show the resulting figure in this notebook too.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. (5 points) Shock analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Create a set of Python functions that isolate candidate shocked cells based on the following methods and sequentially prints the following shock candidate maps into a folder called **\"output_s\"** for all times:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method 1:** Read the 2D velocity vector field. Compute the divergence of the velocity field and isolate the cells where there are convergent flows (i.e. where $\\vec\\nabla\\cdot \\vec v <\\alpha$ with $\\alpha\\lesssim 0$). Cells with convergent flows are candidate shocked cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method 2:** Read the 2D pressure field. Compute the gradient of the thermal pressure and isolate the cells with large pressure gradients (i.e. where $\\frac{|\\vec\\nabla P|}{P}>\\beta\\max{\\left(\\frac{|\\vec\\nabla P|}{P}\\right)}$ with $\\beta \\lesssim 0.1$). Such cells are candidate shocked cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Make binary maps of the resulting candidate shock cells from both methods. Show sample maps at a fixed time (VTK file # 50) in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. (5 points) Fourier analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Create a set of Python functions that Fourier transforms the thermal pressure of any VTK file in 2D, applies high-pass and low-pass filters, smooths the pressure map using a 2D Gaussian, and sequentially prints the following figures into a folder called **\"output_f\"** for all times:\n",

    "Show sample maps at a fixed time (VTK file # 50) in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Create a Python function that reads in the images you wrote, and returns movies showing the time evolution of the magnetic pressure gradient maps computed in (a), the high-pass filter maps in (e), and the flow circulation in (b).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. (5 points) Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "(g) Based on your analyses above, briefly answer the following questions (**in your own words**): \n",
    "\n",
    "- What information do the velocity curl and magnetic pressure gradient provide about the flow in section 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the flow circulation reach steady state in section 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do you find the same shock candidates on the maps obtained by Methods 1 and 2 in section 2?\n",
    "  \n",
    "- What do the high-pass and low-pass filter maps show in section 3?\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Are the low-pass and Gaussing blurring results consistent with one another in section 3?"
