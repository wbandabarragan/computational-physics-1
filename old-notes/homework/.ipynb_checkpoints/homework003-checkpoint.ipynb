    "# General statement: shock-cloud interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Shock waves are flow discontinuities that arise in supersonic gases when the local flow speed exceeds the sound speed of the gas. When shocks interact with gas clouds, they can accelerate them and disrupt them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we numerically study one of such interactions where a shock wave propagates across a 2D computational domain (along the Y-axis from the bottom to the top), interacting with a cylindrical cloud in slab geometry. In the simulation, the cloud gas is tracked with a pigment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow is adiabatic (the polytropic index is $\\gamma=\\frac{5}{3}$), the gas is ionised (the mean particle mass is $\\mu = 0.6$), and the gas is also magnetised (the magnetic field is initially perpendicular to the flow, so it is oriented along the X-axis).\n",
